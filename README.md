# Visual Expression Analysis from Face Images
<p align="justify">
A research work on human sentiment/emotion analysis that published as a book chapter in the "Springer" within the title of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-93247-3_12" terget="_blank">Visual Expression Analysis from Face Images Using Morphological Processing</a>. I also did my thesis in this research before publication.

<b>"face_detection_using_Haarcascade"</b> file implements the detection of human face using Haarcascade algorithm where in <b>"face_detection_using_MTCNN"</b> implements the same thing using MTCNN(Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithm. Both file also contain the implementation of various machine learnign algorithm such as Logistic Regression classifier, SVM classifier, Random Forest classifiers and so on.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<b>"Sentiment_analysis_using_CNN"</b> file has the CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm, a deep learning approcah to analysis the human emotion from the image.
